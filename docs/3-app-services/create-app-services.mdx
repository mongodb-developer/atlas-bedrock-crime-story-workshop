# Create an Atlas App Services application

MongoDB Atlas, have a rich set of application services that allow a developer to host an entire application logic (Authentication, permissions, functions, triggers etc.) with a generous free tier.

We will leverge this ability to stream line development and data integration in minutes of work.

1. Start by navigating to the **App Services** tab.

        src={useBaseUrl('/img/chapter-2-app-services/app-services-tab.png')}
    />

1. You’ll be prompted to select a starter template. Let’s go with the **Build your own App** option that’s already selected. Click the **Next** button. 
1. Next, you need to configure your application.
    - **Data Source**: Since we have created a single cluster, Atlas already linked it to our application.
    - **(Optional) Application Name**: Let’s give our application a meaningful name such as **flyAirBNB**.
    - **(Optional) App Deployment Model**: Change the deployment to **Single Region** and select the region closest to your physical location.
1. Click the **Create App Service** button to create your first App Services application!
1. Once the application is created we need to verify datasources are linked to our cluster, visit **Linked Data Sources** tab:
    - Our atlas cluster with a linked name of `mongodb-atlas`
