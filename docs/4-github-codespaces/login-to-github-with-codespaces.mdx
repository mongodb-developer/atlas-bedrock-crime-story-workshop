# Set your http endpoint here

Its time to test our backend and data services. We will use the created search HTTPS endpoint to show a simple search page on our data.

You will need to get the HTTPS Endpoint URL we created as part of App Services setup.

:::tip
Just for a sanity check you can use our prebuilt environment:

## Play with the front end

We will clone an existing VUE js project to setup our front end. This is a simple project that will allow us to search our data.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/mongodb-developer/atlas-bedrock-crime-story-demo.git
```

## Configure the front end
1. Create a file called `.env` in the root of the project
2. Add the following to the file:
```bash
APP_SERVICES_BASE_URI=<your endpoint url>
APP_SERVICES_API_ENDPOINT=getSearch
APP_SERVICES_GENEATE_MEDAL_ENDPOINT=generateMedal

```

## Install the front end
1. Install the dependencies
```bash
npm install
```

## Run the front end
1. Run the front end
```bash
npm run serve
```

## Test the front end
1. Open a browser and navigate to `http://localhost:8080`
