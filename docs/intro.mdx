|Workshop goal|Learn how to use MongoDB Atlas Data Platform to unleash the power of data|
|-|-|
|What you'll learn|How to set up Atlas developer data platform to integrate with AWS Bedrock and build one of the selected projects|
|What tools you'll need|MongoDB Atlas free tier, AWS bedrock credentials, Node.js, NPM|
|Time to complete|1.5h|

[MongoDB Atlas](https://www.mongodb.com/atlas/database) is the best way to deploy, manage, and grow MongoDB in the Cloud. Today, we will leverge the Atlas data platform to integrate AWS Bedrock AI Services , load the data with minimal code to an Atlas cluster and use Atlas Vector search capabilities to power a frontend Web UI.

The Application we are building is a nice game of "find the criminal" using vector search capabilities on an Evidence database. 
The idea of the game is that users will be able to communicate with a chat bot acting as a crime investigator against a database of evidence. 

The user will be able to upload images or text and those will be searched for similartity against MongoDB Atlas using Bedrock embeddings.The RAG part comes into play when the found documents will be piped into an LLM by Bedrock and the results will be returned to the user.

The application will be built using the following technologies:
- [MongoDB Atlas](https://www.mongodb.com/atlas/database)
- [MongoDB Atlas App Services](https://www.mongodb.com/products/platform/atlas-app-services)
- [AWS Bedrock](https://aws.amazon.com/bedrock/) AI Services
- -  [Titan](https://aws.amazon.com/bedrock/titan/) Embeddings
- -  [Cohere Command](https://aws.amazon.com/bedrock/cohere-command-embed/c√ß) LLM

**Alternative to the game**

If you are not interested in the game, you can still follow the tutorial and build a simple web application that will allow you to search for similar images in a database of products.

Those chapters are marked with "Product Catalog" in the title.

Even better, no prior knowledge of MongoDB or Node is required!

## Agenda

1. [MongoDB Atlas: Cloud Database Setup](/docs/category/mongodb-atlas-cloud-database) - Get up and running in MongoDB Atlas by creating your first MongoDB Atlas database.
1. [MongoDB Data Platform setup](/docs/category/mongodb-atlas-app-services---crime-stroy) - Create application, triggers and webhooks to host the application logic
1. [Atlas Search setup](/docs/category/add-atlas-search-vector-index---crime-story) - Implement vector search capabilities based on Bedrock embeddings
1. [Connect the Data platform to your application](/docs/category/connect-the-front-end-to-app-services) - Configure our sample application to consume the App services you created.
