|Workshop goal|Learn how to use MongoDB Atlas Data Platform to unleash the power of data|
|-|-|
|What you'll learn|How to set up Atlas developer data platform to integrate with AWS Bedrock and build one of the selected projects|
|What tools you'll need|MongoDB Atlas free tier, AWS bedrock credentials, Node.js, NPM|
|Time to complete|1.5h|

[MongoDB Atlas](https://www.mongodb.com/atlas/database) is the best way to deploy, manage, and grow MongoDB in the Cloud. Today, we will leverge the Atlas data platform to integrate AWS Bedrock AI Services , load the data with minimal code to an Atlas cluster and use Atlas Vector search capabilities to power a frontend Web UI.

The Application we are building is a nice game of "find the criminal" using vector search capabilities on an Evidence database.

Even better, no prior knowledge of MongoDB or Node is required!

## Agenda

1. [MongoDB Atlas: Cloud Database Setup](/docs/category/mongodb-atlas-cloud-database) - Get up and running in MongoDB Atlas by creating your first MongoDB Atlas database.
1. [MongoDB Data Platform setup](/docs/category/mongodb-atlas-app-services) - Create application, triggers and webhooks to host the application logic
1. [Atlas Search setup](/docs/category/add-atlas-search-vector-index) - Implement vector search capabilities based on Bedrock embeddings
1. [Connect the Data platform to your application](/docs/category/connect-the-front-end-to-app-services) - Configure our sample application to consume the App services you created.
